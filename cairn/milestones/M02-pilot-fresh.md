# M02: Pilot — fresh adoption in one package repo

- **Status:** in-progress   <!-- mirror; cairn/ROADMAP.md is the authority -->
- **Priority:** high
- **Depends on:** M01
- **Branch/PR:** — (work happens in the pilot repo; this file tracks it)

## Goal

Prove the system end-to-end in a package repo with no existing tracking
system.

## Scope

**In:** `/cairn-init` fresh scaffold; ≥3 full milestones (plan → implement →
review); one `/milestone-brief` RB/RR escalation; one `/cairn-release` walk;
friction captured as candidate rows on this repo (issues also accepted).

**Out:** migration testing → M03. Fixing the friction found → v0.2 planning
after both pilots.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Scaffold created by `/cairn-init` with no manual fixes needed.
- [ ] 3 milestones shipped through all three phase skills, chips used at
      each transition.
- [ ] One RB/RR cycle completed and ingested.
- [ ] One release walk completed to the handoff checklist.
- [ ] Every friction point captured as a candidate row on cairn (or filed
      as an issue).

## Tasks

- [x] Choose the pilot repo (a package without an existing system).
- [x] Run `/cairn-init`; note anything manual.
- [x] Ship 3 milestones; log friction as candidates.
- [ ] Run one RB/RR escalation; one release walk.
- [ ] Summarize findings in this file's Review section.

## Work log

- 2026-07-11: planned as part of the v0.1 pilot plan (DRAFT_2 §11).
- 2026-07-11: openac chosen as pilot repo; installed in Claude Desktop via
  Customize → Plugins (skills load un-namespaced; `/plugin` and
  `--plugin-dir` are terminal-only — README should document this path).
- 2026-07-11: /cairn-init scaffold + DESIGN interview underway in openac;
  finding: DESIGN-elicitation question quality markedly better on Fable
  than Opus (same AskUserQuestion format) → candidate row + notes in
  references/design-interview-notes.md.
- 2026-07-11: second (principle-focused) Fable interview also judged
  excellent; pass-2 moves distilled into the notes; Jeff proposes two-pass
  interview (overall → principles) as gold standard → candidate updated.
- 2026-07-11: friction during first openac milestone implement: chat
  output volume disorienting (stage unclear) and oversized question chips
  crowd out chat context → output-discipline/stage-orientation candidate
  added; chip minimize/side-by-side flagged as Desktop app feedback.
- 2026-07-11: resumed via /milestone-implement; status in-progress.
  Catch-up from openac git: scaffold complete and functioning; openac M01
  (os_read) and M02 (of_read) shipped through full plan→implement→review
  cycles (2 of ≥3); M03–M05 planned; no RB/RR or release walk yet.
- 2026-07-11: friction: openac scaffold predates D-008, uses project/ not
  cairn/ — rename disposition pending user decision.
- 2026-07-11: gate: user approved renaming openac project/ → cairn/ now;
  executed in openac (its D-007, commit 3c81c7b, pushed).
- 2026-07-11: plan amendment (gate-approved): friction criterion changed
  from "filed as issues" to "captured as candidate rows (or issues)" —
  matches established practice (5 candidates banked, 0 issues).
- 2026-07-11: gate: Jeff drives remaining pilot work (3rd milestone, RB/RR,
  release walk) in openac Desktop sessions for pilot fidelity; openac M04
  (check hygiene) chosen next. This session tracks; catch-up from openac
  git on resume.
- 2026-07-11: friction (openac + tidymedia): chip option descriptions too
  technical — unclear what's being chosen and why it matters → folded into
  output-discipline candidate. Also: Desktop chips can be minimized without
  closing, softening the earlier chip-layout concern.
- 2026-07-11: catch-up from openac git: M04 (check hygiene) shipped through
  full plan→implement→review (PR #3, archived) — 3rd milestone criterion
  met. Remaining: one RB/RR cycle, one release walk.
